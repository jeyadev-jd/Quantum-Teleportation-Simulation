## 📖 About The Project

This project is a visually engaging and educational tool designed to demystify the process of quantum teleportation. It's a single, self-contained HTML file built with **Tailwind CSS** and vanilla **JavaScript** that runs entirely in the browser.

Users can select an initial quantum state for Alice, choose a noise model, and then watch step-by-step as the state is "teleported" to Bob. The interface provides real-time feedback, an animated quantum circuit, and explanations of the underlying physics.

### ✨ Core Features

-   **👩‍🔬 Interactive Characters**: Follow Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver) on their quantum adventure.
-   **⚙️ Step-by-Step & Auto-Run**: Manually step through the protocol or let the simulation run automatically at different speeds.
-   **📊 Multiple Noise Models**: See how teleportation fidelity changes under different conditions (Realistic, Depolarizing, Ideal, etc.).
-   **🔬 Animated Quantum Circuit**: An SVG-based circuit diagram comes to life, visualizing each gate and measurement as it happens.
-   **🎯 Real-Time Fidelity Metrics**: Instantly see the success rate (fidelity) of the teleportation and whether quantum advantage was achieved.
-   **📚 Educational Content**: Built-in cards explain what quantum teleportation is, why it matters, and how it relates to physics principles like relativity.
-   **🎨 Modern & Responsive UI**: A sleek, dark-themed interface with smooth animations that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🚀 How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

You can host this simulator for free on the web in just a few minutes using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**:
    -   Create a new public repository on your GitHub account (e.g., `quantum-simulator`).

2.  **Rename the HTML File**:
    -   For GitHub Pages to work automatically, the main HTML file must be named `index.html`.
    -   Rename your `Quantum Teleportation.html` file to **`index.html`**.

3.  **Upload the File**:
    -   Upload the renamed `index.html` file to your new repository.

4.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    -   In your repository, go to the **`Settings`** tab.
    -   In the left sidebar, click on **`Pages`**.
    -   Under "Build and deployment," for the "Source," select **`Deploy from a branch`**.
    -   Under "Branch," select your main branch (usually `main` or `master`) and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
    -   Click **`Save`**.

5.  **View Your Live Site!**
    -   Wait a minute or two for the site to build.
    -   Your live URL will be displayed at the top of the `Pages` settings screen. It will look like: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.
