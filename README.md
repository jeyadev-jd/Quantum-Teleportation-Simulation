## 📖 About The Project

This project is a visually engaging and educational tool designed to demystify the process of quantum teleportation. It's a single, self-contained HTML file built with **Tailwind CSS** and vanilla **JavaScript** that runs entirely in the browser.

Users can select an initial quantum state for Alice, choose a noise model, and then watch step-by-step as the state is "teleported" to Bob. The interface provides real-time feedback, an animated quantum circuit, and explanations of the underlying physics.

### ✨ Core Features

-   **👩‍🔬 Interactive Characters**: Follow Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver) on their quantum adventure.
-   **⚙️ Step-by-Step & Auto-Run**: Manually step through the protocol or let the simulation run automatically at different speeds.
-   **📊 Multiple Noise Models**: See how teleportation fidelity changes under different conditions (Realistic, Depolarizing, Ideal, etc.).
-   **🔬 Animated Quantum Circuit**: An SVG-based circuit diagram comes to life, visualizing each gate and measurement as it happens.
-   **🎯 Real-Time Fidelity Metrics**: Instantly see the success rate (fidelity) of the teleportation and whether quantum advantage was achieved.
-   **📚 Educational Content**: Built-in cards explain what quantum teleportation is, why it matters, and how it relates to physics principles like relativity.
-   **🎨 Modern & Responsive UI**: A sleek, dark-themed interface with smooth animations that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.
